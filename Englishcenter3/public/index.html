"title": "A Letter to My Teacher",
"content": "Dear Miss Li, I am writing to express my sincere gratitude for your guidance this semester. When I first joined your English class, I was nervous about speaking in public and struggled with grammar. You never laughed at my mistakes; instead, you patiently corrected me and encouraged me to practice more. Your interesting stories and interactive activities made English classes enjoyable, not boring. Thanks to you, I have gained confidence to participate in class discussions and my grades have improved greatly. I also learned that learning is a journey that requires perseverance. I will keep working hard in English and live up to your expectations. Wish you a happy life and smooth work. Yours sincerely, Zhang Wei"

I hope you are still passionate about protecting nature and making contributions to the earth. Remember how you volunteered to clean the park every weekend? I hope that spirit never fades. Also, please take good care of your parents—they have given you so much love and support. Don’t forget the friends who stayed with you through thick and thin.

"title": "My Unforgettable Summer Vacation",
"content": "Last summer vacation, I went to the countryside to visit my grandparents with my family. The air there was fresh, and the scenery was beautiful—green fields, clear rivers and lovely birds singing every morning. I helped my grandpa water the vegetables and feed the chickens. Grandma cooked delicious home-made food for us every day, which was much tastier than takeout. In the evenings, we sat under the tree, listened to grandpa’s stories about his childhood and watched the stars. I also made friends with some local kids; we played hide-and-seek and flew kites together. This vacation taught me to enjoy simple life and cherish the time with family. It was an unforgettable experience that I will always remember. I hope I can go there again next summer."

"title": "The Importance of Reading",
"content": "Reading is one of the most valuable activities in our life. It opens a new world for us and enriches our knowledge. Through reading, we can learn about different cultures, histories and sciences without traveling around the world. Books also teach us valuable lessons about life, love and courage. When we feel tired or upset, reading a good book can calm us down and cheer us up. It improves our vocabulary and writing skills, which helps us in our studies. Moreover, reading trains our thinking ability and broadens our horizons. We should develop a good reading habit from an early age. We can read for 30 minutes every day, choose books that interest us. Let’s enjoy reading and grow up with books."

I still remember the days we spent together—we walked to school every morning, shared our snacks during breaks and helped each other with homework. When I was sad about my exam failure, you comforted me and encouraged me to keep trying. When you won the singing competition, I was as happy as you were. I hope your new school is good and you have made new friends. But please don’t forget me. Could you tell me about your new life in your next letter? I will share my school stories with you too. Let’s keep in touch and meet each other during the winter vacation. Wish you all the best. Yours, Lily"

"title": "My Favorite Hobby",
"content": "My favorite hobby is drawing. I started drawing when I was 5 years old, and it has become an important part of my life. I love drawing because it allows me to express my feelings and imagination freely. When I draw, I forget all my worries and focus on the paper in front of me. I like drawing nature best—flowers, trees, mountains and rivers. I often take my sketchbook to the park on weekends, sit on a bench and draw the beautiful scenery around me. My art teacher says I have a talent for drawing and encourages me to practice more. Drawing has also helped me make friends with people who share the same hobby. I hope I can become an artist in the future and show my works to more people."

"title": "How to Protect the Environment",
"content": "Protecting the environment is everyone’s responsibility. Our earth is facing many problems, such as air pollution, water pollution and deforestation. We can do many small things in our daily life to protect it. First, we should save water and electricity—turn off the tap when we brush our teeth and turn off the lights when we leave the room. Second, we should use reusable bags instead of plastic bags to reduce white pollution. Third, we can plant more trees to make the air fresher. Fourth, we should sort garbage so that it can be recycled. Finally, we should tell our family and friends to join us in protecting the environment. If everyone does a little, our earth will become more beautiful and healthy. Let’s start from now on."

"title": "My Dream Job",
"content": "My dream job is to be a doctor. I have wanted to be a doctor since I was a little kid. When my grandma was ill, the doctor took good care of her and made her recover. I was deeply moved by the doctor’s kindness and professionalism. Doctors can help sick people get rid of pain and save lives. It is a noble and meaningful job. To realize my dream, I study hard every day, especially in biology and chemistry. I also read books about medicine in my spare time. I know being a doctor is not easy—it requires a lot of knowledge and hard work. But I will never give up. I will keep working hard to improve myself. I hope one day I can become a good doctor and help more people."

"title": "A Memorable School Activity",
"content": "Last month, our school held a charity sale to help poor children in rural areas. All the students and teachers took part in it. Before the activity, we prepared a lot of things—old books, toys, hand-made crafts and so on. On the day of the sale, the school playground was crowded with people. We set up stalls and tried our best to sell our things. Some students sang songs to attract customers, and some gave small gifts to buyers. I sold my favorite storybook and a hand-made necklace. I raised 150 yuan and donated all of it. Although I felt a little sad to part with my book, I was very happy because I could help others. This activity taught me the importance of helping others and working together. It was a memorable experience for me."
},
{
"title": "A Letter to My Parents",
"content": "Dear Mom and Dad, I am writing to tell you how much I love you. Thank you for giving me life and raising me up. You have taken good care of me since I was born. When I was sick, you stayed by my side day and night. When I made mistakes, you patiently taught me right from wrong. When I achieved progress, you were always proud of me. You work hard every day to give me a better life, but you never complain. I know I am not a perfect child. I sometimes argue with you and make you angry. I am sorry for that. From now on, I will be a good child—listen to your words, help you with housework and study hard. I hope you are healthy and happy forever. I love you more than words can say. Yours, Tom"

{
"title": "My Favorite Season",
"content": "My favorite season is autumn. I love autumn because it is a beautiful and harvest season. The weather in autumn is cool and comfortable—neither too hot nor too cold. The sky is blue and the air is fresh. The leaves on the trees turn yellow and red, falling down like dancing butterflies. It is very beautiful to walk on the road covered with fallen leaves. Autumn is also a harvest season. Farmers are busy harvesting crops—rice, wheat, fruits and vegetables. We can eat a lot of fresh fruits in autumn, such as apples, pears and grapes. I often go hiking with my family in autumn, enjoying the beautiful scenery and fresh air. Autumn makes me feel peaceful and happy. I love this lovely season."

"title": "The Influence of Technology on Our Life",
"content": "Technology has a great influence on our daily life. It makes our life more convenient and efficient. With the development of technology, we can use mobile phones to call, send messages and shop online. We can also use computers to study and work at home, without going out. The Internet helps us get information quickly and easily. We can watch movies, listen to music and talk with friends from all over the world online. However, technology also has some disadvantages. Spending too much time on electronic devices is bad for our eyes and health. Some people are addicted to online games, which affects their studies and work. We should use technology properly—make good use of its advantages and avoid its disadvantages. Let technology serve our life better."

{
"title": "My Favorite Teacher",
"content": "My favorite teacher is my math teacher, Mr. Wang. He is tall and kind, with a warm smile on his face. He is not only a good teacher but also a good friend. Mr. Wang’s math classes are very interesting. He uses funny stories and practical examples to explain difficult math problems, making us easy to understand. When we have questions, he is always patient to answer us, no matter how simple the questions are. He cares about every student. He often talks with us after class, asking about our studies and life. When I was not good at math, he encouraged me to practice more and gave me extra lessons. Thanks to him, my math grades have improved a lot. I am very grateful to Mr. Wang. I will always remember his teachings."

Next, I made scrambled eggs with tomatoes. I beat the eggs into a bowl and stirred them. Then I cut the tomatoes into pieces. I poured some oil into the pan, and when the oil was hot, I put the eggs in. After the eggs were cooked, I added the tomatoes and stir-fried them. Finally, I added some salt and sugar.
